<h1>Max Quinn-Tapara (Ngāti Maniapoto, Te Ati Awa) is currently living and working in Tāmaki Makaurau. Having recently completed a degree in Visual Communication Design (with First Class Honours) from Massey University in Pōneke, he is now working as a graphic designer at <a href="https:/www.haumi.nz" target="blank">Haumi</a>. Previously Max spent two years working at <a href="https://www.scratchdesign.co.nz" target="blank">Scratch</a> with a particular focus in defining, designing and delivering commercial work to clients across construction, hospitality and professional services. Max has an honest but direct approach to design and is interested in intersecting this with a focus on his Mātauranga Māori. Max has a particular focus to typography — interactive and printed media as mediums to communicate visual themes and ideas through his work.
